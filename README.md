This is code for article "A Dual-Stage Deep Learning Multi-Source Precipitation Merging Framework with Physical Constraints for Improving Seasonal and Extreme Precipitation Forecasting"

How to use the code:
The model code used in all articles is generated by running .ipynb files. The filenames contain different model names, such as "xxx-xxxxx-Unet" indicating the use of the Unet model. Files named in Chinese with the suffix "-分类器" represent the classifier of the hybrid model, while those with "-分类器-回归器" denote the regressor of the hybrid model. All data used can be found in the data section of the article, which exclusively employs publicly available datasets downloadable from various institutional websites.  

When using the code, all models generally follow these steps:  
1. Import libraries  
2. Read data  
3. Preprocess data  
4. Define the model  
5. Train and test the model  
6. Save the model and output results  

Ensure all required libraries are installed before importing them. All model code is presented in function form, with detailed usage instructions (parameter definitions) available in the "Python气象自动绘图函数说明" document (written in Chinese). The "Auto_paint_self" file has already been uploaded.
